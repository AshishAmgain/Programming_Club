# Programming_Club
This Programming Club website is a comprehensive static website built with HTML5, CSS3, and  JavaScript (ES6) that showcases modern web development best practices. The project features a responsive, mobile-first design using CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts, with a sophisticated design system built around CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent theming. The website includes 10 fully-featured HTML pages covering all aspects of a student organization, from membership applications to event management and resource libraries. Key interactive features include an automated slideshow/carousel with manual controls, real-time form validation for contact and membership forms, an interactive FAQ accordion system with search and category filtering, and responsive navigation with mobile hamburger menu support. The codebase demonstrates clean architecture with separated concerns (HTML for structure, CSS for styling, JavaScript for interactivity), comprehensive error handling, accessibility features including ARIA attributes, and smooth animations powered by CSS transitions and JavaScript. All content is realistic and tailored for a programming club, with placeholder images from Unsplash and a professional, modern aesthetic that's immediately ready for deployment and customization.
